# Sparse-Depth-Completion

Monocular depth prediction methods fail to generate absolute and precise depth maps and stereoscopic approaches are still significantly outperformed by LiDAR based approaches. The goal of the depth completion task is to generate dense depth predictions from sparse and irregular point clouds. This project makes use of uncertainty to combine multiple sensor data in order to generate accurate depth predictions. (1st place on the KITTI benchmark. Submitted and awaiting response. Code will be publically available on acceptance.)
